            <p>
              <span class="firstcharacter">L</span>
              IKE SOME INTRICATE flying machine, the music of Airborne Charlie is fueled by jazz and birdsong, folk harmony and Bach fugues, all welded to a sturdy frame of Americana. On their eponymous debut, the duo presents a bold, diverse collection of songs that run the gamut of their preoccupations. Recorded in Austin, TX during the winter of 2018, the record is both a glimpse of a moment in time and a sweeping tour through the sensibilities of two musical omnivores. </p>
            <p>At turns disarmingly intimate and explosively orchestral, the songs on the record unfold like a collection of musical vignettes, moving fluidly between gossamer confessionals, groovy nocturnal trysts, and existential country waltzes. Hell, there’s even a Baroque invention buried in there somewhere. A narrower scope would feel untrue to the spirit of the duo, which looks for depth in the weird, humor in the grandiose, and oddness in the straight ahead. </p>
            <p>Airborne Charlie is headed by NYC natives Hans Bilger and Eli Greenhoe. Lifelong friends and collaborators, Eli and Hans grew up learning music and writing songs side by side before continuing their education separately - Hans in the realm of jazz and evolutionary biology, Eli in classical composition. As a duo, they draw from their eclectic training and diverse interests - crafting a sound that is vivid and far-flung, but still deeply rooted in the folk traditions they grew up in. </p>

          <h4 class="text-center epk-heading"> <em>QUOTES</em> </h4>
            <p><em>"The first notes of Airborne Charlie’s eponymous debut album [...] materialize like raindrops on water, delicate and rippling. Luscious harmonies and pillowy bass soon sweep through, filling out a melancholy meditation on time and love that feels like the ride home from a camping trip somewhere near a lake.</p>
            <p>This is a record that recalls the memories you’ve forgotten. Listening is like stumbling onto a Super-8 reel of your formative moments, rendered with the intimacy and pathos of a Bildungsroman. Some of those moments whisper, as with first track “Until,” and others shout, especially on irrepressible second track “Arbiter,” which croons to a lover and, occasionally, a river. Each of the seven songs is distinctive and yet part of a broader spirit, diving headlong into the melting pot of Americana music and bringing a few ingredients too."</em></p>

              <h4 class="text-center epk-heading"> <em>BIO: HANS BILGER</em> </h4>
                <p>
                  <span class="firstcharacter">H</span> ANS BILGER is a bassist, songwriter, and composer from Brooklyn, NY. The eldest in a musical household, he spent his childhood playing folk and country gospel in a family band. The experience colored his later studies of improvised, classical, and experimental music. His mentors include the bassists Greg Cohen (Ornette Coleman, Laurie Anderson, Tom Waits), Samuel Suggs (Concert Artists Guild), Paul Kowert (Punch Brothers), J.A. Granelli (Mr. Lucky), Axel Scherka (Staatskapelle Berlin), Kurt Muroki (Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center), and others.</p>
                <p>Bilger moved to Austin, TX in 2016, where he quickly became a sought-after sideman and session bassist. Recent projects include recordings with Eli Greenhoe, Odell Fox, R.O. Shapiro, Jenner Fox, Micah Motenko, and Will Taylor. Meridian, Bilger’s debut solo album, was released this September by Good Child Music. Bilger is also the composer-in-residence for Cora Dance. He developed original scores for 2018's gifts and Elsewhere, which opens this October. He is currently scoring Cora's new work-in-development, Grove, which premieres in 2021.</p>
                <p>Bilger is also fascinated by the natural world. While studying evolutionary biology at Yale University, he co-authored a study on musical structure in birdsong with the ornithologist Richard Prum and wrote Aviary, a piece that uses songbird songs as raw material for a series of improvisatory and through-composed movements. Last fall, he joined the labs of Julia Clarke and Michael Ryan at UT Austin to start a PhD on the evolution of vocal communication in birds, bats and frogs. His scientific work is supported by fellowships from the National Science Foundation, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and UT Austin.</p>
                <p>Bilger currently lives in Berlin, Germany, where he splits his time between writing, performing, and CT-scanning bat larynges at the Museum für Naturkunde. Further information at <a href="https://www.hansbilger.com/">hansbilger.com</a>.</p>
